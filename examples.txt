Trump Administration Sends 30 Million Nothing To Puerto Rico Victims

WASHINGTON—In an effort to assist victims still struggling from the devastating effects of Hurricane Maria, the Trump administration announced Monday that it was sending 30 million nothing to Puerto Rico. “The people of Puerto Rico need our support, which is why we’re pledging to deliver them tens of millions of nothing whatsoever,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that nothing, on neither ships nor airplanes, would be rushed to the island to help desperate residents recover from the storm that has killed at least 48 people and virtually destroyed the commonwealth’s electrical grid. “Our relief effort includes tons of crucial nothing for the sick and injured, as well as thousands of gallons of fresh, clean nothing for inhabitants literally in danger of dying of thirst. We’ve also marshaled our resources to ensure that the people of Puerto Rico receive this nothing as soon as possible, and they should expect absolutely nothing at all to begin arriving within days.” Sanders went on to say that the Trump administration was also petitioning Congress to pass legislation that would allocate 75.5 billion nothing to help Puerto Rico with ongoing rebuilding efforts.

Maltese journalist's son says she was murdered for exposing corruption

VALLETTA (Reuters) - The son of Malta’s best-known investigative journalist said on Tuesday his mother was killed by a car bomb because of her work exposing political corruption, as hundreds of people held a demonstration to demand justice.
Daphne Caruana Galizia, who wrote about graft across Malta’s political divides on her blog, died when explosives ripped through her car minutes after she left her home in the north of the island on Monday afternoon.
Maltese authorities were waiting for the arrival of Dutch forensic experts and American FBI agents to help the investigations.
“My mother was assassinated because she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it, like many strong journalists,” Matthew Caruana Galizia said on Facebook.
“She was also targeted because she was the only person doing so,” he added. He described rushing to the scene, only to find the burning car and her remains.
On Tuesday afternoon, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the law courts demanding justice for her killing.
One woman carried a votive lamp with the murdered journalist’s picture in it and another carried a sign that read “Looks like we can’t have freedom of speech but we want justice”.
Recently, Galizia had been following up leads from information in the so-called Panama Papers, a large collection of documents from an offshore law firm in the Central American nation that were leaked in 2015.
She was tracing alleged links between Maltese officials and offshore banks and companies used as tax havens.
The killing near the village of Bidnija stunned the Mediterranean island. Authorities said it was the first murder of a journalist there.
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and opposition leader Adrian Delia - who had both been criticised on Galizia’s blog - both condemned the killing.
“Everyone knows Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine, both politically and personally, but nobody can justify this barbaric act in any way,” said Muscat, who had been suing her over some of her allegations.
Opposition leader Adrian Delia called her killing an attack on democracy and freedom of expression and demanded an independent inquiry.
“We will not accept an investigation by the Commissioner of Police, the Army commander or the duty magistrate, all of whom were criticised by Caruana Galizia,” he said on Monday.

Woman tests the limits of hotel's pet policy by taking in her horse
One horse lover wanted to test a hotel's pet policy after one receptionist said it didn't discriminate.
Lindsey Partridge, who in 2015 created Harmony Horsemanship, an organization that helps riders better understand their horses, told ABC News she was driving from Pontypool, Canada, to Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky, when she decided to check into her hotel.
A riding coach, she was there to compete in the Retired Racehorse Project’s Thoroughbred Makeover, in which hundreds of retired racehorses compete in categories such as field hunter, polo, ranch work and trail.
"We left at, like, 3 in the morning, and when we got down there, the hotel is before you get to the horse park," Partridge, 31, recalled. "We figured we may as well stop and unload our luggage."
That's when she spotted a dog in the lobby of the Supreme 8 in Georgetown, Kentucky. She said she remarked to the receptionist that she didn't realize the hotel had a pet policy and joked she had a few horses outside.
"The receptionist said, 'Oh, I don't care. Sure, bring them in.'"
Astonished, Partridge figured she would, taking a few funny photos, which have since earned attention on Facebook, with more than 2,000 reactions. She unloaded her 5-year-old thoroughbred named Blizz, since, she said, "she was the easiest to get off the trailer."
Some hotel guests "were pretty surprised, but they all knew it was fun," Partridge said. "I hope that this shows people that horses really can be quiet, calm and nice."
The owners of Supreme 8 confirmed the incident for ABC News.
They clarified their pet policy in a statement, saying, "We did not know she was going to bring the horse into the facility. We are pet-friendly, and it is [for animals] 25 pounds and under. We had no knowledge of it being in the room."
The funny incident seemed to be good luck for Blizz, which earned third place in the trail competition and sixth in the field hunter competition.

BOMBSHELL: AT LEAST 25 MILLION DEAD AND FRAUDULENT “REGISTERED VOTERS” IN 2016

A study revealing that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton doesn’t account for dead and fraudulent voters, which accounted for over 25 million “registered voters” during the 2012 presidential election – and little has changed since then.
Illegal alien voters combined with dead and “multiple state” voters could easily explain Clinton’s “popular vote” margin over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, especially considering that her “victory” came from Democratic-controlled counties known for illegal immigration and loose voter ID laws such as in New York and California.
“A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate,” NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.
And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado.
It’s also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that there’s likely more dead and invalid voters than before.
“…The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state,” NPR added.
That’s because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency.
Under the “catch and release” immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.
Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump – and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes.
However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.
